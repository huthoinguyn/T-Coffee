                                    <p>I have assisted upset customers in previous roles and have found the best way to handle them is to not argue and apologize for the mistake. After apologizing, I remake the beverage or item that they request and ensure that I make no mistakes. I also hand them their drink or item with a smile afterward to impart the best experience that I can. This method has helped to calm customers and impart an experience that will have them returning. </p>

                                    <p>First, I focus on the task at hand and prepare drinks as quickly as I can while still ensuring quality. I also make sure that everyone is contributing to the flow of the work and stay positive under the increased stress. It is important to remain as calm as I can to make sure that I don't get overwhelmed and that the job gets done. This means taking calming breaths when needed and reassuring the team that we can handle the situation.</p>

I make sure that I leave plenty of time to commute to work and that there is enough of a buffer in case of traffic or other emergencies. If, however, I was running late one day, I would call the manager on shift lead right away to inform them of the situation and reassure them I was on my way. Then, I would try to get someone to either cover my shift or request that they rearrange people until I could get there. Once I arrived, I would apologize to both those working and the manager and get to work right away.</p>
